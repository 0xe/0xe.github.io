# Hi!

I'm a software developer with about fifteen years of experience designing and building software systems.

Currently, I'm working on implementing the JavaScript programming language to run on the JVM at ServiceNow.

Previously, I've worked on implementing Oauth2 and SAML authorization protocols and API Gateways at Concur (acquired by SAP) and MoEngage. 

Even earlier, I've worked on building automation systems and schedulers at Calm.io (acquired by Nutanix).

This page is mostly about my projects.

## Writings:

I occasionally write something here.

- My Ladakh motorcycle trip

## Current Projects:

- Nadaswara: A simple app to help practise singing _Swaras_ of _Ragas_ in Carnatic music. Allows you to define the base *sa* note so you can follow along with exercises at your own pitch. Available on the iOS app store.

- SIMPLE: A simple programming language (a bare-bones subset of JavaScript) that I use for experimenting with language implementations. Has two implementations currently:
  * AST-walking interpreter in Java
  * Bytecode compiler for Java (WIP)

- CLUMSY: A statically-typed variant of Lisp (with a terrible name..) focusing on bare-metal compilation. Has a compiler with a custom code-generator for armv8/macos and x86_64/linux. Compiles to the following targets:
  * arm64 assembly on macos

## Old Projects:

- Signer: An NGINX module to sign and verify JSON web tokens.

- Retrogames: Clones of classic games we've spent years playing as children. Mostly as an excuse to learn programming languages
  * Arkanoid: OutBreak (in C++)
  * Tetris: BrickLock (in Rust)
  * Space invaders: HackAttack (TODO)
  
- SCAM: A lisp interpreter written in Clojure quite similar to how SICP implements it and also the base for the AST-walking interpreter for simple. I implemented it for a talk I gave about it.

- SCRATCH: Implementations of a few useful algorithms and data structures and throw-away code.

## Open Source:

I contribute to the Rhino project which is a JavaScript runtime written on the JVM. I've also made a few contributions to the SWC project previously.
