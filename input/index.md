# Hi!

I'm a software developer with about fifteen years of experience designing and building software systems.

Currently, I'm working on implementing the JavaScript programming language to run on the JVM at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com).

Previously, I've worked on implementing Oauth2 and SAML authorization protocols and API Gateways at [Concur](https://www.concur.com) (acquired by SAP) and [MoEngage](https://www.moengage.com). 

Even earlier, I've worked on building automation systems and schedulers at [Calm.io](https://www.nutanix.com/products/cloud-manager/self-service) (acquired by Nutanix).

This page is mostly about my projects.

## Writings:

I occasionally write something here.

- My motorcycle trip to [Ladakh](ladakh/).

## Open Source:

I contribute to the [Rhino project](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/commits/master/?author=0xe) which is a JavaScript runtime written on the JVM.

## Projects:

- Nadaswara: A simple app to help practise singing _Swaras_ of _Ragas_ in Carnatic music. Allows you to define the base *sa* note so you can follow along with exercises at your own pitch. Available on the [iOS app store](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/6749471155/distribution/info).

- SIMPLE: A [simple programming language](https://github.com/0xe/simple) (a bare-bones subset of JavaScript) that I use for experimenting with language implementations. Has two implementations currently:
  * AST-walking interpreter in Java
  * Bytecode compiler for Java (WIP)

- CLUMSY: A statically-typed variant of Lisp (with a terrible name..) focusing on bare-metal compilation. Has a [compiler](https://github.com/0xe/clumsy) with a custom code-generator for armv8/macos and x86_64/linux. Compiles to the following targets:
  * arm64 assembly on macos

- Signer: An [NGINX module to sign and verify](https://github.com/0xe/signer) JSON web tokens.

- Retrogames: Clones of [classic games](https://github.com/0xe/retrogames) we've spent years playing as children. Mostly as an excuse to learn programming languages
  * Arkanoid: OutBreak (in C++)
  * Tetris (in Rust)
  
- SCAM: A [lisp interpreter](https://github.com/0xe/scam) written in Clojure quite similar to how SICP implements it and also the base for the AST-walking interpreter for simple. I implemented it for a talk I gave about it.

- SCRATCH: Implementations of a [few useful algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/0xe/scratch) and throw-away code.
